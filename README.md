# Final_Proj_v2
Civilization
Welcome to our game of civilization!

It's not much to look at now, but it will be cool soon, I think!

Your units will be highlighted in yellow on the screen! Make sure you have the required save files before starting a new game: "new_civs.save",
"new_tm.save", and "new_map.save". These files are directly imported into the game and are required for the game to function (copies of them
can be found in the cmake-build-debug folder here on the github!

Essentially, destroy your enemies and build the largest empire you can! (empire building to come)
